Overview
========

There are multiple test suites in the RabbitMQ Java client library;
the source for all of the suites can be found in the test/src
directory.

The suites are:

  Client tests
  Functional tests
  Server tests
  Performance tests
  SSL tests

All the tests require a RabbitMQ server listening on localhost:5672
(the default settings).

All the test suites can be run with the command ant test-suite. To run
specific test suites see the instructions below.


Running a Specific Test Suite
=============================

To run a specific test suite, but not the others, you should execute
one of the following in the top-level directory of the source tree:

  ant test-client
  ant test-functional
  ant test-server
  ant test-ssl

Note that to run the SSL tests, the RabbitMQ server should be
configured to use SSL as per the SSL with RabbitMQ guide.

For example, to run the client tests:

----------------- Example shell session -------------------------------------
rabbitmq-java-client$ ant test-client
Buildfile: build.xml

test-prepare:

test-build:

amqp-generate-check:

amqp-generate:

build:

test-build-param:

test-client:
    [junit] Running com.rabbitmq.client.test.ClientTests
    [junit] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 2.388 sec

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

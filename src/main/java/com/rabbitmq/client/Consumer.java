 * thread which is separate from the {@link Connection}'s thread. This

 * Connection} methods without causing a deadlock.

 * dispatch threads. {@link Consumer}s should avoid executing long-running code
 * because this will delay dispatch of messages to other {@link Consumer}s on the same
 * {@link Channel}.
 *
 * For a lambda-oriented syntax, use {@link DeliverCallback},
 * {@link CancelCallback}, and {@link ConsumerShutdownSignalCallback}.
